Notes on the recording function:
A folder HDF-Radio is automatically created for the recording path.
The recordings are stored in folders with the name of the station.
Only the currently running station is recorded.
Settings and switching are locked during a recording.
If there is less than 15MB of free space, no recordings can be started.
The cleanup function deletes incomplete recordings, advertisements and empty folders.

Information about favorites:
By default, your own favorites are saved in the file /etc/enigma2/hdfradio_userlist.
Additional favorite lists can also be created in the menu.
The file /etc/enigma2/hdfradio_userlist_{new name} is created.
The favorites are automatically updated when the radio list is updated.
Furthermore, the favorite lists can be renamed, edited or deleted in the menu.

Notes on the radio logos:
A separate subfolder can be created for each category in the main list.
For 'Mixed Channels' categories the common folder 'Mixed Channels' is accepted.
The path for the stream would therefore be: {selected path}/{category}/{streamname}.jpg
Or globally for the category: {selected path}/{category}/{category}.jpg
If the stream is not included in the main list: {selected path}/{streamname}.jpg
Supportet formats are 'jpg' and 'png'. The size should be about 150x150px.

Additional Information:
To display the title and cover, the ServiceApp must be set to Original or only the ServiceHisilicon must be installed.
The display of the cover works completely without ServiceApp and ServiceHisilicon.
When the plugin is started, the last station is played automatically.
The Youtube player uses the queries from the Taapat Youtube plugin.
This plugin is automatically installed in the HDF image.
